# Migrating Your On-Premises Data Warehouse to Amazon Redshift with AWS SCT

In this lab, you will migrate a sample Oracle data warehouse to Amazon Redshift. You will first setup the environment using a CloudFormation template. The CloudFormation template will create a RDS Oracle data warehouse, Redshift cluster and three EC2 instance. The Windows EC2 machine will have the AWS SCT installer and requried drivers and other two EC2 Linux machine will have the AWS SCT Data Extraction agents RPM. You will need to install and configure the agents to extract your data and move to Amazon Redshift. You will need a Mac or Windows computer with a Firefox or Chrome browser.
